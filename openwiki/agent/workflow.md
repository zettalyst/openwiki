# Agent workflow

The documentation agent is implemented in `src/agent/`. It takes a command (`chat`, `init`, or `update`), gathers repository context, builds prompts, runs a DeepAgents session, and records successful update metadata — but only if the documentation content actually changed.

## Main flow

`src/agent/index.ts` follows this sequence for non-chat runs:

1. Load `~/.openwiki/.env` into `process.env`.
2. For `update` commands with no explicit user message, check `getUpdateNoopStatus()` — if nothing has changed since the last successful update, return early with `{ skipped: true }` and never reach steps 3+. See "Update no-op skip" below.
3. Resolve the provider via `resolveConfiguredProvider()` and ensure the provider's API key exists.
4. Resolve the model ID from CLI input, `OPENWIKI_MODEL_ID`, or the provider's default model.
5. Create a run context from Git state and prior update metadata.
6. Snapshot the current `openwiki/` content hash (before the run).
7. Build the system prompt and user prompt.
8. Create the provider-specific model client (`ChatAnthropic`, `ChatOpenRouter`, or `ChatOpenAI`).
9. Create a DeepAgents `LocalShellBackend` rooted at the repository with a SQLite checkpointer.
10. Stream messages and tool events back to the CLI.
11. For `init` and `update`, compare the post-run content snapshot to the pre-run snapshot. Write `openwiki/.last-update.json` **only if the content changed**.

Chat runs skip metadata writes entirely, and never hit the no-op skip (which only applies to `update`).

## Update no-op skip (pre-run)

Before any provider or model work happens, `shouldCheckUpdateNoop(options)` returns `true` for `update` runs that have no explicit `userMessage` (plain `--update` or scheduled runs; an `/update <message>` follow-up is exempt). When true, `getUpdateNoopStatus(cwd)` in `src/agent/utils.ts` inspects the repository _before_ touching the agent:

1. There must be a prior `openwiki/.last-update.json` with a `gitHead`. No metadata → don't skip.
2. `git status --short --untracked-files=all` must show no meaningful changes (lines that only touch `openwiki/.last-update.json` are ignored, since that file is the metadata itself). Any other change → don't skip.
3. If HEAD has moved since `lastUpdate.gitHead`, every path changed in that commit range must live under `openwiki/`. If any changed path is outside `openwiki/` (or the range is empty because of an unreachable head), don't skip.

If all checks pass, `runOpenWikiAgent()` emits a short "no repository changes detected" text event and returns `{ command, model: noopStatus.model, skipped: true }` — no model client, no DeepAgents session, no prompt is built. This is separate from (and cheaper than) the post-run content-snapshot check described below, which still applies to full runs that do reach the agent. `test/update-noop.test.ts` covers the clean-worktree, dirty-worktree, OpenWiki-only-commit, and source-commit cases.

## Provider-specific model creation

`createModel()` in `src/agent/index.ts` branches by provider:

- **anthropic**: resolves credentials in the order `ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`, then `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN`. API keys use the existing `ChatAnthropic` API-key path. Bearer tokens inject an `@anthropic-ai/sdk` client with `apiKey: null`, `authToken`, and `anthropic-beta: oauth-2025-04-20`. `CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN` additionally prepends the OpenWiki Claude Code billing system block so subscription-routed Sonnet requests are not treated as generic bearer API calls. When `ANTHROPIC_BASE_URL` is set, the resolved alternative base URL is passed as `anthropicApiUrl` so requests can be routed to a self-hosted or proxied Anthropic-compatible endpoint instead of the default API.
- **openrouter**: `new ChatOpenRouter({ apiKey, baseURL, model, models, route: "fallback", siteName: "OpenWiki" })` — passes a fallback model list so OpenRouter can route around server-side failures.
- **baseten / fireworks / openai / openai-compatible**: `new ChatOpenAI({ apiKey, configuration: { baseURL? }, model })` — OpenAI-compatible clients using the provider's base URL when configured. The `openai-compatible` provider has no default endpoint; its base URL is user-supplied via `OPENAI_COMPATIBLE_BASE_URL` and required (`requiresBaseUrl: true`), which lets OpenWiki target any OpenAI-compatible gateway (for example a LiteLLM gateway fronting upstream providers).

Base URLs are resolved through `resolveProviderBaseUrl()` in `src/constants.ts`, which prefers a provider's alternative base URL environment variable (`baseUrlEnvKey`) over the built-in default before falling back to the SDK's own default endpoint. Providers marked `requiresBaseUrl` are validated at startup by `ensureProviderBaseUrl()`.

## Prompting strategy

`src/agent/prompt.ts` encodes the product rules directly into the system prompt. The agent is instructed to:

- inspect the current codebase and write documentation under `openwiki/`,
- use filesystem discovery tools and git history rather than inventing facts,
- keep the initial wiki focused and navigable,
- avoid thin/slim pages — merge stubs into broader pages rather than creating many small directories,
- document the repository for both humans and future agents,
- respect the repository root as the only project in scope,
- avoid reading secrets or `.env` files,
- use git history for init and update runs,
- respect the temporary plan file and update metadata requirements,
- ensure top-level `/AGENTS.md` and/or `/CLAUDE.md` reference the OpenWiki quickstart (inserting or refreshing a standardized section).

The user prompt changes with the command:

- `init` includes the current Git summary and asks for fresh documentation.
- `update` includes last update metadata and a Git change summary.
- `chat` just forwards the user message.

## Git evidence and update metadata

`src/agent/utils.ts` is responsible for the repository evidence that the prompt sees:

- current working tree status,
- current HEAD,
- a change window since the last successful update when `.last-update.json` includes a `gitHead` or `updatedAt`,
- the most recent 20 commits with changed files for init runs (or updates without prior metadata),
- a diff summary against HEAD.

On successful init/update runs where content changed, the agent writes JSON metadata with:

- `updatedAt`
- `command`
- `gitHead`
- `model`

That metadata is later used to scope update runs.

### Content snapshot

`createOpenWikiContentSnapshot()` computes a SHA-256 hash of the entire `openwiki/` directory tree (excluding `.last-update.json`). The agent runtime takes a snapshot before and after the run. If they match — meaning the model made no documentation changes — the metadata file is not updated. This prevents scheduled update loops from churning the metadata when the wiki is already current.

## Model fallback and retries

The agent runtime includes a retry strategy for OpenRouter:

- the selected model is tried first,
- server-side OpenRouter failures (HTTP 5xx) fall back through `OPENROUTER_FALLBACK_MODEL_IDS`,
- retries keep the same command and repository context but use a modified thread ID to avoid checkpointer collisions.

Non-OpenRouter providers do not use the fallback list — only the selected model is attempted.

## Why this matters

The agent is not just a generic chat wrapper. It is intentionally constrained so it can:

- write repository-local docs without wandering outside the repo,
- preserve continuity across runs via checkpointing and metadata,
- keep updates grounded in Git evidence,
- avoid metadata churn via the content-snapshot check,
- support both interactive and scheduled maintenance use cases.

## Things to watch when changing agent behavior

- Keep the prompt in sync with the actual filesystem tools and path conventions used by the CLI.
- Be careful with `.last-update.json` semantics, because update runs use it to decide what changed since the previous successful run.
- The content-snapshot check means a no-op update will not update metadata. If you change the snapshot logic, ensure `.last-update.json` is still excluded.
- Credential loading happens before model resolution; changes there affect both onboarding and agent startup.
- When adding a provider, add a branch in `createModel()` and ensure the API key env key is checked in `ensureProviderKey()`.
- The DeepAgents backend is configured with `virtualMode: true`, which is important for documentation-only behavior.
- The no-op skip only looks at `openwiki/.last-update.json` and git state — it does not re-run the content-snapshot hash. If you change what counts as an "OpenWiki path" or how the metadata file is excluded from `git status`, update `getUpdateNoopStatus()` and its tests together.
- The no-op skip is bypassed whenever a caller passes a non-blank `userMessage` (e.g. `/update please also check X`), so explicit follow-up update requests always run the agent.
